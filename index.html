  In this unit I learned about <B>basics of the web</B> which are:
<br>
The web: collection of HTML Docs<br>
HTML: Hyper Text Mark-up Language which is the main type of document of the web <br>
URLs: asimple protocol to communicate with the browser, the Internet and the Servers <br>
HTTP<br>
<em>Web Apps</em>.<br>
<br>
<Heading> <b> HTML </b> </Heading>
<br>
it is made up of:<br>
Text Content<br>
Markup<br>
Refs to other docs<br>
Links to other pages<br>
<br>
<heading><b>HTML Markup</b></heading>
<br>
is composed of opening tag and closing tag. This is also referred to as <em>element</em><br>
Some examples of HTML markups that I learned are: <b>BOLD</b>, <em>Italic</em>,<br>
<br>
Computers are called "stupid" by the programmers because of the way they understand the instructions<br>
given to them by the human programmers.<br>
<br>
<br>
<heading><b>HTML Atts</b></heading>
<br>
which is the same as tags but it has Attribute = "value"
<br>
for example Anchor tag is used to link a text to a web page. 
<br>
like: click <a href"https://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a> to go to its website
<br>
<em>Void tags</em>: has no contents
<br>
<br>
<b>Inline/Block</b>
<br>
Inline tags simply end a line<br>while Block tags make <em>invisible box</em> in which text is typed
<br>
<br>
<heading><b>HTML Docs</b></heading>
<br>it includes <em>doctype, title, content</em>,
